Because of my laziness, I've never spent some time to make a backup of my ~/.*rc files. As a consequence of that, whenever I get a new computer I lose all my config files and need to start collecting personalization stuff for .*rc files on the web again.

I created this repository to have a centralized place to store this kind of files and to update them with new interesting stuff I encounter on the web. Feel free to use the code available here and if you think the code could be improved, I'd be happy to hear your suggestions. =)
